📡 OpenAI Web-Search Chatbot using Qwen3-4B
This project is a Google Colab-based chatbot that combines a Hugging Face LLM (Qwen3-4B) with live web search capabilities. It is designed to generate real-time, citation-backed answers using Google search and NLP tools, and is wrapped in a clean Gradio UI for easy interaction.

🔍 Project Overview
Purpose:
Build a lightweight yet powerful chatbot that doesn’t just guess — it reads from the web. This chatbot:

Takes a user’s question

Searches the internet for answers

Extracts article content

Builds a prompt using the most relevant info

Uses the Qwen3-4B model to generate a citation-rich response

Displays it in a styled chat interface

🛠️ Components & Tools Used
Hugging Face Transformers (Qwen/Qwen3-4B)

The language model that interprets user queries and writes intelligent responses.

Googlesearch-python & newspaper3k

Searches the web and extracts readable content from article links.

Gradio

Provides an interactive chatbot UI that runs in the browser.

PyTorch

Backend framework for model execution.

Custom Prompt Engineering

Dynamically builds a citation-rich prompt that the LLM can understand.

🧠 How It Works
User inputs a question
E.g., “What are the effects of climate change on agriculture?”

Web search and parsing
The web_search() function:

Finds top 10 results on Google

Downloads and cleans article text

Extracts summaries and URLs

Prompt construction
The answer_with_citations() function:

Formats all snippets with numbered tags and links

Creates a full prompt ending with Answer: for the model

Model generation
The Qwen3-4B model:

Reads the prompt

Generates a contextual, cited answer

Chatbot UI

The chat_fn() function handles interaction

Gradio displays the chat history with bubble styling

🚀 How to Run
In Google Colab:
Open the notebook (OpenAi-ChatBot.ipynb)

Run each cell in order:

Install dependencies

Load the model and tokenizer

Define the web search and answer functions

Launch Gradio UI

Make sure to add your Hugging Face token when prompted.

Locally:
Download the notebook and run it in Jupyter Lab or Google Colab with GPU support.

Install all required packages using pip.

✅ Use Cases
Real-time Q&A bots

Research summarizers

Educational tools

Assistants for news and current affairs

📌 Notes
Avoid sharing personal Hugging Face tokens publicly.

Web scraping might not always retrieve clean content (fallbacks are handled).

Add rate limiting if deploying at scale to avoid search bans.
