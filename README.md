# OpenAi-Chatbot
This project is a fully functional, web-based AI assistant powered by the Qwen3-4B language model from Hugging Face. Built in Google Colab and deployed using Gradio, the chatbot can answer user queries with real-time information pulled from the internet, complete with source citations for trust and transparency.
